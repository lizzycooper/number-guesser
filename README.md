## From the Codecademy challenge: Number Guesser

This challenge had an existing front-end, and partial back-end. I created all the functions in script.js.

The game allows the user to choose an integer between 0-9, and the computer also guesses an integer (randomly). A second integer is then chosen, and the program calculates who was closer, the human or the computer. Running totals are taken of the winner of each round.

I added validation to ensure the user is inputting a valid number. I also updated the front-end to prevent them from entering number 10.
